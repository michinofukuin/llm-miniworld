Here is the game called Cliff Walking:
The game starts with the player at location [3, 0] of the 4x12 grid world with the goal located at [3, 11]. If the player reaches the goal the episode ends.
A cliff runs along [3, 1..10]. If the player moves to a cliff location it returns to the start location.
The player makes moves until they reach the goal.
Starting State
The episode starts with the player in state [36] (location [3, 0]).
Reward
Each time step incurs -1 reward, unless the player stepped into the cliff, which incurs -100 reward.
Episode End
The episode terminates when the player enters state [47] (location [3, 11]).
Please use the reward machine to describe it

The reward machine $R_{PSA}$ for the Cliff Walking game can be defined as follows:

Propositional symbols:
$\mathcal{P} = \{atGoal, onCliff\}$

Environment states:
$S = \{1, 2, ..., 48\}$

Actions:
$A = \{up, down, left, right\}$

Reward machine:
$R_{PSA} = <U, u_0, F, \delta_u, \delta_r>$

where:
- $U = S \times \{0, 1\} \times \{0, 1\}$ is the set of states of the RM. Each state $u$ is a triple $(s, g, c)$, where $s \in S$ is the current environment state, $g$ is a boolean indicating whether the player is at the goal or not, and $c$ is a boolean indicating whether the player is on the cliff or not.
- $u_0 = (36, 0, 0)$ is the initial state of the RM.
- $F = \{(47, 1, 0)\}$ is the set of terminal states, where the player is at the goal.
- $\delta_u: U \times 2^\mathcal{P} \rightarrow U \cup F$ is the state-transition function. It is defined as follows:
  - For actions $up, down, left, right$:
    - If $g = 1$ (player is at the goal), remain in the same state: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (s, g, c)$.
    - If $c = 1$ (player is on the cliff), return to the initial state: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (36, 0, 0)$.
    - Otherwise, move to the new state according to the environment dynamics:
      - If $a = up$ and $s \notin \{1, 2, 3, 13, 23, 24, 25, 35\}$, move up: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (s-12, g, c)$.
      - If $a = down$ and $s \notin \{12, 22, 32, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46\}$, move down: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (s+12, g, c)$.
      - If $a = left$ and $s \notin \{1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 36, 24, 12, 48, 47\}$, move left: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (s-1, g, c)$.
      - If $a = right$ and $s \notin \{12, 24, 36, 48, 37, 25, 13, 49, 1, 2\}$, move right: $\delta_u((s, g, c), \sigma) = (s+1, g, c)$.
  - If the player is on the goal location $[3, 11]$, change $g$ to 1: $\delta_u((47, 0, c), \sigma) = (47, 1, c)$.
  - If the player steps on the cliff $[3, 1..10]$, change $c$ to 1: $\delta_u((s, g, 0), \sigma) = (s, g, 1)$.
- $\delta_r: U \rightarrow [U \times U \rightarrow \mathcal{R}]$ is the reward-transition function. It is defined as follows:
  - For all non-terminal states, the reward is -1: $\delta_r((s, g, c))((s', g', c')) = -1$.
  - If the player enters the terminal state at the goal, the reward is 0: $\delta_r((47, 1, 0))((47, 1, 0)) = 0$.
  - If the player steps on the cliff, the reward is -100: $\delta_r((s, g, 1))((36, 0, 0)) = -100$.

Based on the game rules you have described, we can define the propositional symbols $\mathcal{P}$ as:
- $G$: the player has reached the goal state
- $C$: the player is on a cliff state

Additionally, we define the set of environment states $S$ as the set of all possible locations in the game grid (each location identified by a unique index from 0 to 47). The set of actions $A$ consists of the possible moves that the player can make in each state (up, down, left, right), but we do not need to explicitly model them in the reward machine.

With these definitions, we can build the reward machine $R_{PSA}=<U, u_0, F, \delta_u, \delta_r>$ as follows:

- $U$ = {0, 1, ..., 48}, representing the possible states of the reward machine, including all environment states and two additional states for the goal ($u_{goal}$) and for the cliff ($u_{cliff}$).
- $u_0$ = 36, representing the starting state of the game.
- $F$ = {$u_{goal}$}, representing the terminal state (goal).
- $\delta_u$ is defined as follows:
  - $\delta_u(u, \sigma) = u_{cliff}$ if $u \in \{3, 4, ..., 10\}$ and $\sigma = \{C\}$ (player is on a cliff state)
  - $\delta_u(u, \sigma) = u_{goal}$ if $u = 47$ and $\sigma = \{G\}$ (player has reached the goal state)
  - $\delta_u(u, \sigma) = u'$, where $u'$ is the new state after the player makes a move from state $u$, and $\sigma$ is the set of propositions that are true in the new state $u'$. Note that if the player moves into a cliff state, they will return to the start state [36].
- $\delta_r$ is defined as follows:
  - $\delta_r(u) = -100$ if $u_{cliff}$
  - $\delta_r(u) = 0$ if $u \in S$ and $u \neq u_{cliff}$ and $u \neq u_{goal}$ (standard time penalty)
  - $\delta_r(u_{goal}) = 0$ (no penalty for goal state)

This reward machine captures the rules of the Cliff Walking game as described, and can be used in reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents to play the game with the goal of maximizing their long-term reward.
